    "- higly effective\n",

    "- lot more stable in results, as in running again will give similar result\n",
    "- 96% of the malware was missclassified\n",
    "- total of 46144 bits were changed across all 500 odd rows and 3000 odd cols, which is pretty small but effective changes. Only around 0.0032% of the dataset was chaned for a 96% success\n",
    "- For every successfull\n",
    "    - JSMA adds 6 Ben and 3 Mal features (average)\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "- kinda effective\n",
    "- Super fast\n",
    "- calculate across total loss and attacks. Much faster than focusing on each row\n",
    "- highly unstable, every run can yeild anywhere from 90% to 10% missclassification\n",
    "- There were many successfull attacks(changed malware into ben) and a few unwanted bad cases(changed ben into mal)\n",
    "-Seeing separately based on outcome of attack\n",
    "    - Good Attacks (3987) => Malware into Ben\n",
    "        - For Classifying a Malware into a Benign, The FGSM approximately adds around 997 extra Benign Features and 883 extra malware features in the APKs\n",
    "    - Bad Attacks (237) => Ben into Mal\n",
    "        - For a bad attack, that is changing a ben into a mal classification, the FGSM added approx 582 Ben cols and 764 mal cols\n",
    "    - Attacks that didn't work (1073)\n",
    "        - in the no change category, FGSM added approx 705 ben and 868 mal cols.\n",
    "- Seeing the whole picture\n",
    "    - FGSM adds an approx 918 ben cols and 874 mal cols to a row while attacking\n",
    "    - When it adds more ben that mal features, then it missclassifies. It does come under this case a lot but there are a significant number of cases where it adds more malicious features to sometimes even makes a benign classification as malicious as demonstrated above\n",
